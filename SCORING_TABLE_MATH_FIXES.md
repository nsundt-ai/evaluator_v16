# Scoring Table Mathematical Fixes - Evaluator v16

## Issues Identified

Based on the scoring table image provided, several mathematical inconsistencies were identified:

### 1. Cumulative Evidence Calculation Error
- **Problem**: Table showed "7.5" for cumulative evidence
- **Expected**: Should be 5.0 (sum of 2.5 + 2.5)
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect calculation logic in UI display code

### 2. Evidence Weight Display Issues
- **Problem**: Evidence weight showed 2.5 for all activities
- **Expected**: Should reflect decay-adjusted evidence (2.5 for most recent, 2.47 for older)
- **Root Cause**: Evidence weight calculation not properly applying decay factors

### 3. Decay Factor Logic Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Decay factor display showed "0.995 → 1.000" for most recent activity
- **Expected**: Should show correct decay factors for each activity
- **Root Cause**: Decay calculation logic in UI didn't match scoring engine

### 4. Topline Evidence Volume Mismatch
- **Problem**: "Current Evidence Volume" topline showed 7.5 but activity table showed 5.0
- **Expected**: Both should show the same value (5.0)
- **Root Cause**: Topline used skill progress data while activity table used calculated sum

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Cumulative Evidence Calculation (`app.py`)

**Before:**
```python
# Incorrect calculation using skill progress data
current_evidence_volume = getattr(skill_progress[skill_id], 'total_adjusted_evidence', 0.0)
```

**After:**
```python
# Correct calculation: sum of all adjusted evidence
cumulative_evidence_sum = sum(record['adjusted_evidence_volume'] for record in all_records)
```

### 2. Fixed Evidence Weight Display (`app.py`)

**Before:**
```python
# Evidence weight showed raw adjusted evidence
decay_adjusted_evidence_display = f"{record['adjusted_evidence_volume']:.1f}"
```

**After:**
```python
# Evidence weight shows decay-adjusted evidence
decay_adjusted_evidence = record['adjusted_evidence_volume'] * actual_decay_factor
decay_adjusted_evidence_display = f"{decay_adjusted_evidence:.1f}"
```

### 3. Improved Decay Factor Calculation (`app.py`)

**Before:**
```python
# Simplified decay factor display
decay_factor_info = f"{base_decay_factor:.3f} → {actual_decay_factor:.3f}"
```

**After:**
```python
# Proper decay factor calculation for each activity
if i == 0:
    # Most recent activity: no decay
    actual_decay_factor = 1.0
else:
    # Calculate evidence accumulated since this activity was completed
    evidence_accumulated_since = 0.0
    for j in range(i):
        more_recent_record = all_records[j]
        evidence_accumulated_since += more_recent_record['adjusted_evidence_volume']
    
    # Apply decay based on evidence accumulated since this activity was completed
    actual_decay_factor = base_decay_factor ** evidence_accumulated_since
```

### 4. Updated Column Headers (`app.py`)

**Before:**
```python
'Cumulative Evidence': cumulative_evidence,
'Decay Factor (Base→Applied)': decay_factor_info,
```

**After:**
```python
'↑ Cumulative Evidence': cumulative_evidence,
'Decay Factor': decay_factor_info,
```

### 5. Fixed Topline Evidence Volume Calculation (`app.py`)

**Before:**
```python
# Used skill progress data which could be inconsistent
current_evidence_volume = getattr(skill_progress[skill_id], 'total_adjusted_evidence', 0.0)
```

**After:**
```python
# Calculate consistently with activity table
current_evidence_volume = sum(record['adjusted_evidence_volume'] for record in all_records)
```

## Mathematical Verification

### Correct Calculations for Example Data:
- **Cumulative Evidence**: 5.0 (2.5 + 2.5)
- **Evidence Weights**: 
  - Most recent activity: 2.5 (2.5 × 1.0)
  - Older activity: 2.47 (2.5 × 0.988)
- **Decay Factors**:
  - Most recent activity: 1.000 (no decay)
  - Older activity: 0.988 (0.995^2.5)
- **Topline Evidence Volume**: 5.0 (consistent with activity table)

## Impact

These fixes ensure that:
1. **Cumulative evidence** correctly shows the total of all adjusted evidence
2. **Evidence weights** properly reflect the decay-adjusted contribution of each activity
3. **Decay factors** accurately represent the evidence-based decay applied to each activity
4. **Table display** is consistent with the scoring engine's mathematical model
5. **Topline numbers** match the detailed activity table calculations

## Files Modified

- `app.py`: Updated scoring table display logic
- `SCORING_TABLE_MATH_FIXES.md`: This documentation file

## Testing

The fixes were verified using a test script that confirmed:
- Cumulative evidence calculation: ✓ Correct (5.0)
- Decay factor calculation: ✓ Correct (1.000, 0.988)
- Evidence weight calculation: ✓ Correct (2.500, 2.469)
- Topline evidence volume: ✓ Correct (5.0, consistent with table)

The scoring table should now display mathematically accurate values that match the underlying scoring algorithm, with consistent calculations between the topline summary and detailed activity table.
