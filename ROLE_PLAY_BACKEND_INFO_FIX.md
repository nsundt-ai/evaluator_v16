# Role Play Backend Information Exposure Fix

## Problem Description

The role play activities were exposing backend coaching information to students, including:

1. **Character Profile**: Detailed character background and personality information meant for the AI system
2. **Scenario Context**: Backend coaching instructions and context meant for the AI system  
3. **Objectives**: Backend coaching objectives meant for the AI system

This information was being displayed in:
- Activity instructions shown to students
- Initial role play conversation messages

## Root Cause

The issue was in `app.py` where backend information from the activity's `content` section was being added to the student-facing instructions:

```python
# Lines 1588-1591 (BEFORE FIX)
if 'scenario_context' in content:
    instructions = f"**Scenario Context:** {content['scenario_context']}\n\n{instructions}"
if 'character_profile' in content:
    instructions = f"{instructions}\n\n**Character Profile:** {content['character_profile']}"
if 'objectives' in content:
    # ... objectives display code
```

And in the role play conversation initialization:

```python
# Lines 2816-2817 (BEFORE FIX)  
character_profile = content.get('character_profile', 'AI Character')
scenario_context = content.get('scenario_context', 'General conversation')
initial_message = f"Hello! I'm {character_profile}. {scenario_context}"
```

## Solution

### 1. Removed Backend Information from Student Instructions

Commented out the code that was exposing backend information to students:

```python
# Lines 1588-1591 (AFTER FIX)
# Remove backend information from student view
# if 'scenario_context' in content:
#     instructions = f"**Scenario Context:** {content['scenario_context']}\n\n{instructions}"
# if 'character_profile' in content:
#     instructions = f"{instructions}\n\n**Character Profile:** {content['character_profile']}"
# if 'objectives' in content:
#     # ... objectives display code
```

### 2. Enhanced Role Play Conversation Initialization

Instead of exposing backend information directly, the system now generates an in-character introduction using the backend information internally:

```python
# Lines 2816-2830 (AFTER FIX)
# Get character info from activity - use character profile for AI persona
content = activity.get('content', {})
character_profile = content.get('character_profile', 'AI Character')
scenario_context = content.get('scenario_context', 'General conversation')

# Generate initial message in character persona using backend info internally
try:
    initial_prompt = f"""You are an AI character in a role-playing educational scenario. 

CHARACTER PROFILE: {character_profile}
SCENARIO: {scenario_context}

Generate a brief, natural introduction message (1-2 sentences) as this character would introduce themselves in this scenario. Keep it conversational and in-character. Respond with only the character's introduction message, no extra formatting or explanations."""
    
    # Use the backend to generate the initial message
    backend = init_backend()
    llm_response = backend['llm_client'].call_llm_with_fallback(
        system_prompt="You are a helpful AI character in an educational role-playing scenario.",
        user_prompt=initial_prompt,
        phase='role_play'
    )
    
    if llm_response and hasattr(llm_response, 'success') and llm_response.success:
        initial_message = llm_response.content
    else:
        # Fallback to generic character introduction
        initial_message = f"Hello! I'm here to help you with this role play activity. How can I assist you today?"
        
except Exception as e:
    # Fallback to generic greeting if there's an error
    initial_message = "Hello! I'm here to help you with this role play activity. How can I assist you today?"
```

### 3. Maintained Proper Student-Facing Content

The system already correctly uses student-facing content from `activity_generation_output.components[0].student_facing_content`, which includes:

- **stem**: Main task description
- **scenario**: Student-facing scenario description
- **given**: Given information for students
- **instructions**: Detailed instructions for students

## Backend Information Usage

The backend information (character_profile, scenario_context, objectives) is properly used internally by the AI system for:

1. **AI Character Generation**: The role play prompt generation correctly uses backend information to create appropriate AI responses
2. **Character Persona**: The initial message is generated in the character's persona using backend information
3. **Evaluation**: The evaluation system uses backend information for assessment
4. **Internal Processing**: Backend information guides the AI's behavior without exposing it to students

## Files Modified

- `app.py`: Lines 1588-1591 and 2816-2830

## Testing

The fix ensures that:
- Students only see appropriate, student-facing content
- Backend coaching information remains hidden from students
- AI characters introduce themselves in their proper persona
- AI system continues to function properly using backend information internally
- Role play activities maintain their educational effectiveness and immersion

ðŸ“‹ Activity Instructions

**Task:** Coach a junior product manager on reframing a technical complaint into a user-centered problem statement. Use a collaborative approach to guide their learning and build their problem framing skills.

**Scenario:** You're mentoring Alex Kim, a junior PM with an engineering background who tends to think in technical terms. Alex has received a complaint from the development team: 'The API response times are terrible - some queries take 8+ seconds. The database architecture is outdated and we need to refactor the entire backend to improve performance.' Alex wants to write this up as a problem statement but is focused on the technical solution rather than the user impact.

**Instructions:** Guide Alex through reframing this technical complaint into a user-centered problem statement. Use short, conversational exchanges to: 1) Help Alex think from the user perspective, 2) Identify the real user friction caused by slow performance, 3) Collaboratively construct an actionable problem statement, 4) Build Alex's confidence in user-centered thinking. Keep your responses brief and coaching-focused.

**Given Information:** Technical complaint: API response times of 8+ seconds, outdated database architecture, backend refactoring needed. Alex has engineering background and thinks technically rather than user-centered.
