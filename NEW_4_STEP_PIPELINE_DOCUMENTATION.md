# New 4-Step Evaluation Pipeline - Evaluator v16

## Overview

The evaluation pipeline has been optimized from the previous 5-phase system to a streamlined 4-phase process that reduces LLM calls, improves efficiency, and maintains comprehensive evaluation quality. This document describes the new pipeline structure, benefits, and implementation details.

## Pipeline Architecture

### Previous System (5 Phases)
1. **Rubric Evaluation** (LLM call)
2. **Validity Analysis** (LLM call) 
3. **Scoring** (No LLM call)
4. **Diagnostic Intelligence** (LLM call)
5. **Feedback Generation** (LLM call)
6. **Trend Analysis** (LLM call - now disabled)

**Total LLM Calls:** 5 calls per evaluation

### New System (4 Phases)
1. **Summative Evaluation** (LLM call) - Combined rubric + validity
2. **Scoring** (No LLM call) - Skill score calculation
3. **Intelligent Feedback** (LLM call) - Combined diagnostic + feedback
4. **Trend Analysis** (Disabled) - Feature disabled during development

**Total LLM Calls:** 2 calls per evaluation

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Summative Evaluation
**Purpose:** Combined rubric assessment and validity analysis in a single integrated step

**What it does:**
- Evaluates learner response against activity rubric
- Assesses evidence quality and validity simultaneously
- Determines validity modifier for scoring adjustments
- Provides comprehensive performance analysis

**Output Structure:**
```json
{
  "aspect_scores": [
    {
      "aspect_id": "string",
      "aspect_name": "string",
      "score": 0.0-1.0,
      "rationale": "string",
      "evidence_references": ["string"],
      "subskill_evidence": {}
    }
  ],
  "overall_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "rationale": "string",
  "validity_modifier": 0.0-1.0,
  "validity_analysis": "string",
  "validity_reason": "string",
  "evidence_quality": "string",
  "assistance_impact": "string",
  "evidence_volume_assessment": "string",
  "assessment_confidence": "string",
  "key_observations": ["string"]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates redundancy between rubric and validity analysis
- Ensures consistency between performance and validity assessment
- Reduces processing time and LLM costs

### Phase 2: Scoring
**Purpose:** Calculate skill scores and progress metrics

**What it does:**
- Processes evaluation results through scoring engine
- Calculates cumulative skill scores with position-based decay
- Determines gate statuses (performance and evidence gates)
- Updates learner progress tracking

**Output Structure:**
```json
{
  "activity_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "target_evidence_volume": 5.0,
  "validity_modifier": 1.0,
  "adjusted_evidence_volume": 5.0,
  "final_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "aspect_scores": [],
  "scoring_rationale": "string"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant processing (no LLM calls)
- Maintains dual-gate scoring system
- Provides comprehensive skill progress tracking

### Phase 3: Intelligent Feedback
**Purpose:** Combined diagnostic analysis and student-facing feedback generation

**What it does:**
- Analyzes performance patterns and maps to subskills
- Identifies demonstrated vs. missing competencies
- Generates motivational, actionable student feedback
- Provides specific recommendations and next steps

**Output Structure:**
```json
{
  "intelligent_feedback": {
    "diagnostic_analysis": {
      "strength_areas": ["string"],
      "improvement_areas": ["string"],
      "subskill_performance": [
        {
          "subskill_name": "string",
          "performance_level": "proficient|developing|needs_improvement",
          "development_priority": "high|medium|low"
        }
      ]
    },
    "student_feedback": {
      "performance_summary": {
        "overall_assessment": "string",
        "key_strengths": ["string"],
        "primary_opportunities": ["string"],
        "achievement_highlights": ["string"]
      },
      "actionable_guidance": {
        "immediate_next_steps": ["string"],
        "recommendations": ["string"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates redundancy between diagnostic and feedback phases
- Ensures consistency between analytical insights and student guidance
- Provides comprehensive, actionable feedback in a single step

### Phase 4: Trend Analysis
**Purpose:** Historical performance analysis and learning trajectory assessment

**Status:** **DISABLED** - Logic and strategy still in development

**What it will do when enabled:**
- Analyze historical performance patterns
- Calculate learning velocity and growth trajectories
- Identify consistent strengths and recurring challenges
- Provide personalized recommendations based on learning history
